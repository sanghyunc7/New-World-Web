                with a grain of salt, especially if you're overclocking. However, for this
                build, I suggest a 500 watt semi modular model (SFX for some ITX builds.
                But that's another discussion for another day)

                dual tower air cooler like the nh-d15 or an AIO liquid cooler. Don't 
                even think about a custom loop for a Ryzen 3600.

                chunk of your budget for this bad boy. Prepare to spend at least 400 CAD 
                just for a mid-tier card.

                the front too if you have any left.

                Get an NVMe. Makes your life easier. Add 2.5 inch ones later on for 
                additional capacity. Please don't get a hard drive.

        <h3>Accessory</h3>
        <p>Accessories don't matter for dull boring people. But if you're the type looking to download
            ram, you should also consider adding lots of RGB to your build. There are several performance
            boosts you can attain from it. They vary by the color:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>red: adds 10% overclocking potential without VRM issues.
                Additional 5% boost when used in combo with each AMD hardware used.
            </li>
            <li>blue: 10% boost to cooling.
                Using Team Blue's chips gives no additional benefits.
            </li>
            <li>green: 10% reduction in power draw.
                10% boost to minimum fps when using Nvidia gpus.
                Also enable RTX capability to GTX cards once per turn. Shout "Nvidia fanboy" to activate.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
